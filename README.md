Automatic Fixes for Simple SEO Best Practices

This project is currently in a very early stage.

I continually get stuck doing very routine tasks that simply make more sense to automate.

These are usually focused on SEO details, ADA Compliance or other best practices.

I plan on building this up more over time and improving it's user-friendliness, but the current items include:

- Add target="_blank" to anchor tags that do not contain specified keyword (i.e. https://your-domain.com)
- Add rel="noopener noreferrer" to all anchor tags with target="_blank" (a security feature)
- Add a default alt tag to any images missing it (not ideal, but for ADA compliance it's better to have this than nothing)
